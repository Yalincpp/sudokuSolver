Basic sudoku solver

This sudoku solver uses the Backtracking Algoritmn (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms) that tries numbers 1-9 on the first empty cell until one fits in.
If a number fits in (First one if two or more numbers fit in) it continues to the next empty cell.
If none of the numbers 1-9 fits in the cell, the program returns to the cell before, leaving the other empty.
Lastly, the program checks if the solved state is right, just for double confirmation.
